## Overview

The width and height utilities can be used to adjust a component's properties when certain breakpoints are reached. For example, a full-width button on small screens can be set to its initial size when the `md` breakpoint is reached.

These utilities are not recommended for general layout purposes. They should be used to enable responsive behaviors of certain components through breakpoints.

## Breakpoints

base (no breakpoint value), -on-sm, -on-md, -on-lg, -on-xl

**Example: .pf-u-w-initial-on-md**

## Width properties:

| Class | Applied To | Outcome |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `.pf-u-w-auto{-on-[breakpoint]}`    | `*` |  Sets width: auto    |
| `.pf-u-w-initial{-on-[breakpoint]}` | `*` |  Sets width: initial |
| `.pf-u-w-inherit{-on-[breakpoint]}` | `*` |  Sets width: inherit |
| `.pf-u-w-25{-on-[breakpoint]}`      | `*` |  Sets width: 25%    |
| `.pf-u-w-50{-on-[breakpoint]}`      | `*` |  Sets width: 50%    |
| `.pf-u-w-75{-on-[breakpoint]}`      | `*` |  Sets width: 75%    |
| `.pf-u-w-100{-on-[breakpoint]}`     | `*` |  Sets width: 100%    |

## Height properties:

| Class | Applied To | Outcome |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `.pf-u-h-auto{-on-[breakpoint]}`    | `*` |  Sets height: auto    |
| `.pf-u-h-initial{-on-[breakpoint]}` | `*` |  Sets height: initial |
| `.pf-u-h-inherit{-on-[breakpoint]}` | `*` |  Sets height: inherit |
| `.pf-u-h-25{-on-[breakpoint]}`      | `*` |  Sets height: 25%    |
| `.pf-u-h-50{-on-[breakpoint]}`      | `*` |  Sets height: 50%    |
| `.pf-u-h-75{-on-[breakpoint]}`      | `*` |  Sets height: 75%    |
| `.pf-u-h-100{-on-[breakpoint]}`     | `*` |  Sets height: 100%    |
