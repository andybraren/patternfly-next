## Overview

An alert group that includes the `.pf-m-toast` modifier becomes a Toast Alert Group with unique positioning and notification-like alert behavior. `.pf-c-alert-group` is required to create a Toast Alert Group.

Alerts within the group should not include any actions, links, or buttons except for a close button that dismisses the alert. If more than three toast alerts need to be shown at the same time, a unique third toast should include a single secondary action button to view all notifications within a notification drawer.
